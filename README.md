## Purpose
As the world grapples with COVID-19, every ounce of technological innovation and ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic brings us one step closer to overcoming it.
 
AI, a core technology of the fourth industrial revolution, has come up as an important non-medical intervention to overcome the current global health crisis, to build next-generation epidemic preparedness, and to move towards a resilient recovery.

Effective screening enables quick and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 and can mitigate the burden on healthcare systems

 In this project,we propose two Machine learning models to assist in faster screening of COVID 19.
 
 
 ## Model 
Our model(s) aim to predict whether a person has a risk of COVID19 through chest X-rays and  symptom checker.
Once predicted positive the user will have the opportunity to input their zip code and search hospitals within a 15 miles radius.
